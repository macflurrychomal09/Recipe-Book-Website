            <h1>Non Veg Briyani</h1>
            <p class="description">Non-veg biryani is a flavorful and aromatic dish that combines long-grain rice with tender pieces of meat, 
                usually chicken, mutton, or seafood. It's a popular dish in South Asian cuisine, 
                known for its rich blend of spices and layers of flavors. 
                The meat is marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices before being cooked with fragrant basmati rice, 
                creating a hearty and satisfying meal. Garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes boiled eggs,
                 non-veg biryani is a beloved dish enjoyed by many for its complexity and depth of taste.</p>
